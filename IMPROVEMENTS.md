# Project Improvements: NeuroYield

## 1. State Management
- Integrated [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for scalable and simple state management.
- Store created in `src/store/appStore.ts`.
- Usage demonstrated in `App.tsx` with a counter example.

## 2. Error Handling
- Implemented a global error boundary in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
- The app is wrapped with this component in `App.tsx` to catch and display user-friendly error messages.

## 3. Tailwind CSS Audit & Optimization
- Tailwind CSS classes are used consistently across components.
- Recommendations:
  - Remove unused Tailwind classes from components.
  - Use Tailwindâ€™s built-in purge feature to reduce CSS bundle size.
  - Group utility classes for readability and maintainability.

### Next Steps
- Continue auditing for unused styles and refactor for semantic clarity.
- Consider adding automated tools for CSS optimization (e.g., PurgeCSS).
- Expand Zustand usage for more complex state needs as the app grows.
- Monitor error boundary effectiveness and extend to more components if needed.
