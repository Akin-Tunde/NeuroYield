# Project Architecture

## Overview
NeuroYield is a modular, scalable web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The codebase is organized for maintainability and feature growth.

## Structure
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI and feature components
- `src/pages/`: Top-level route components
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions

## Design Principles
- Separation of concerns
- Reusability
- Type safety
- Accessibility

## Next Steps
- Document data flow and state management in detail
- Add diagrams for key modules
