# TypeScript Usage

## What Changed
- Enforced strict type checking across the codebase
- Improved type coverage for components, hooks, and utilities

## Why
- To catch bugs early and improve code reliability
- To make the codebase easier to maintain and refactor

## How
- Enabled strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Added missing type annotations and interfaces
- Used type-safe APIs and libraries

## Next Steps
- Monitor type coverage with tools
- Continue enforcing type safety for new code
